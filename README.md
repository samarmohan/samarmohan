# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Samar

I'm currently working on my portfolio and organizing my github profile so check back later.

I like making cool (but mostly useless) tools for everyone to use.
Right now I like making web stuff with TypeScript (sveltekit and t3 stack) and algorithm things with Java. Trying to learn Haskell.
