# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Samar

I'm currently working on my portfolio, so check back later.

I like making cool (but mostly useless) tools for everyone to use.
I'm building web apps with TypeScript and SvelteKit, making resilient cloud apps with Go, doing DSA with Java, and learning Haskell! Email me if you want to chat.
